# D3-Challenge
hw for D3

Here is my hw submission for the D3 homework

I was able to complete the required portion fully.

In the index.html where you call the app.js, I have two lines of code for required and bonus work. The one calling app.js should be uncommented from load and it will show the required work for the hw. 

inside the app.js file I have everything labeled and cleaned for submission. I did Obesity vs Income

I made a second .js file called appBonus that held my bonus work. I did not want to manipulate the app.js file and risk losing the required portion. In the index.html just comment out the app.js line and uncomment the appBonus line to see the bonus work.

I was able to get multiple things loaded onto the x-axis with proper transitions between but did not find a way to get multiple things loaded onto the y-axis. I found that dificult and will be something I revisit in the future to ensure I can understand it a bit better as I do think it is a cool aspect.

Thank you. Have a good week/weekend!
